# My_Portfolio
In this folder, I am going to show how to code the daily sentiment score,sentiment strategy on stock and bond, bag of words, TF-IDF, and BERT(upload later) in Python.
I used the Apple headline dataset to do the sentiment score, and then we calculate the return for the Apple stock and bonds based on the sentiment score.The result you can see on "Sentiment Strategy on stock"and" Sentiment Strategy and Bond return Calculation"
Based on the dataset, I further used it to train the machine learning model by using word embedding method, such as Bad of words,TF-IDF. All the results, you can browse on "Bag of Words and XGBoost" and TF-IDF and xgboost".
